### System requirements

It is recommended to deploy the software on a Linux system. Pre-install PyQt5 (Qt) and PyTorch. Devices that support cuda allow for smoother software usage. 

### Quick Start

Set up the software environment:

```shell
conda create -n UniSPAC python=3.9
conda activate UniSPAC
git clone https://github.com/ddd9898/UniSPAC.git
cd UniSPAC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download test data and checkpointsï¼š

```shell
bash ./download.sh
```

The total files after data and model decompression take up **9.3GB** of storage, so please make sure you have enough capacity. See the downloaded model weights in the `checkpoints` folder and the Hemi-Brain-ROI-1 test data in the `data` folder. 

Finally, launch the software:

```shell
python demo.py
```
